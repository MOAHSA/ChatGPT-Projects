# Keyboard Layout Flipper Pro - Simple User Guide

Welcome to Keyboard Layout Flipper Pro! This guide will help you use the application without any technical knowledge.

## What Does This Program Do?

This program helps you convert text between English and Arabic keyboard layouts. For example:
- If you type "Hello" on an Arabic keyboard, it will look like this: "حاللو"
- This program converts it back to "Hello" in English
- It works both ways - English to Arabic and Arabic to English

## Getting Started - Quick Setup

1. **Double-click** the program file to start it
2. You'll see a window with buttons and text boxes - that's the main interface
3. The program also minimizes to a small icon in the bottom-right corner of your screen (system tray)

## How to Use - Two Easy Methods

### Method 1: Quick Conversion (Recommended)
This is the fastest way to convert text anywhere on your computer:

1. **Select text** - Highlight any text you want to convert (in any program - browser, Word, etc.)
2. **Press Ctrl+Shift** - Hold both buttons at the same time
3. **Magic!** - The text automatically converts and replaces the original

**Examples:**
- Select "اثممخ" and press Ctrl+Shift → becomes "Hello"
- Select "Hello" and press Ctrl+Shift → becomes "اثممخ"

### Method 2: Manual Conversion
Use this when you want to type or paste text directly:

1. **Type or paste** your text in the top box (Input Text)
2. **Click Convert** - Press the blue "Convert" button
3. **See result** - The converted text appears in the bottom box (Output Text)
4. **Copy result** - Click "Copy Output" to copy the result to clipboard

## System Tray - Your Quick Access

When you close the program window, it doesn't really close - it goes to the system tray (bottom-right corner):

- **Right-click** the icon for menu options:
  - Show - Bring back the main window
  - Convert Clipboard - Convert whatever text you copied last
  - Enable/Disable Hotkey - Turn the Ctrl+Shift feature on/off
  - Remove from Startup - Stop program from starting automatically
  - Quit - Completely close the program

- **Left-click** the icon to quickly show the main window

## Essential Settings You Should Know

### Change the Shortcut Keys
Don't like Ctrl+Shift? Change it:
1. Click the gear icon
2. Type your new shortcut in "Current hotkey" (like "Ctrl+Alt+Z")
3. Click "Save Settings"
4. Restart the program (close and open again)

### Start Automatically
Make the program start when you turn on your computer:

### Other Useful Options

## Pro Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Instant Clipboard Conversion
1. Copy any text (Ctrl+C)
2. Right-click the system tray icon
3. Click "Convert Clipboard"
4. Paste the converted text anywhere (Ctrl+V)

### Tip 2: Quick Actions
The buttons under the "Quick Actions" section do useful things:
- Convert Clipboard - Convert whatever is in your clipboard
- Open History - See all your previous conversions
- Clear History - Delete your conversion history
- Export Text - Save your converted text to a file

### Tip 3: Language Detection
The program automatically detects which language your text is in, so you don't need to tell it "this is English" or "this is Arabic" - it figures it out by itself!

### Tip 4: Keyboard Shortcuts (For the Main Window)
When the main window is active:
- Ctrl+Enter = Convert text
- Ctrl+C = Copy output
- Ctrl+V = Paste input
- Ctrl+L = Clear everything
- Ctrl+H = Show this help
- Esc = Hide to system tray
