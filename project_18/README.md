## Troubleshooting

### Hotkey Issues
- **Hotkey not working**: 
  - Try running the application as administrator
  - Check if the hotkey is being used by another application
  - Verify the hotkey combination in Settings
  - Restart the application after changing hotkey settings

- **Hotkey adds extra characters**: 
  - This has been fixed in the latest version with hotkey suppression
  - If you still experience this issue, please report it

- **Hotkey works in some applications but not others**: 
  - Run the application as administrator for system-wide compatibility

### Conversion Issues
- **Text not converting properly**: 
  - Make sure the correct source language is selected
  - Try using the auto-detect feature
  - Check if the text contains special characters that may not convert

### Startup Issues
- **Application not starting on startup**: 
  - Check Windows Task Manager → Startup tab
  - Make sure the "Run on Startup" option is enabled in Settings
  - Verify the application is not blocked by antivirus software
  - Check if the registry entry was created successfully

### General Issues
- **Application crashes on startup**: 
  - Check if all required dependencies are installed
  - Try deleting the configuration file to reset settings
  - Ensure you're using a compatible Python version

- **UI appears broken or elements are missing**:
